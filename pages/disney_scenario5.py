        "Disneyland Paris, previously known as Euro Disney, opened in 1992. It's a big park with lots of attractions. The idea for the park started a long time ago, but it took a while to get built. It's located near Paris and is very popular among tourists [1].\n\n"
        "## Facilities \n"
        "Disneyland Paris has two main parks: Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park. There are lots of rides and shows, but it's hard to see everything in one visit. The park is big, so you need to plan your day carefully. There are also some hotels and a shopping area called Disney Village. It's a fun place to visit, especially if you like Disney movies [2].\n\n"
        "## Visitor Numbers \n"
        "A lot of people visit Disneyland Paris every year. In recent years, it has been very busy, with millions of visitors coming from all over the world. The exact numbers are impressive, but it's clear that the park is one of the most popular tourist spots in Europe. The park seems to get busier during holidays and summer months [3].\n\n"
        "## Notable Recent Events \n"
        "Disneyland Paris has had some exciting events lately. They celebrated a big anniversary recently, which was a big deal. The park also keeps adding new attractions and areas, which makes it interesting for visitors. Additionally, Disneyland Paris has a nice app that helps you plan your visit and avoid long lines. The park's food is also quite good, with lots of themed restaurants and cafes. Overall, it's a great place to spend time with family or friends [4].\n\n"
