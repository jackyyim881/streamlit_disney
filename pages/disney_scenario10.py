        "## Introduction to Disneyland Paris \n"
        "Disneyland Paris, originally known as Euro Disney Resort, opened on April 12, 1992, marking a significant milestone in European entertainment. The idea for the park began to take shape in the late 1970s, but it wasn't until the success of Tokyo Disneyland in 1983 that the project gained momentum. An agreement with French authorities was signed in 1987, and construction started in 1988. The resort has since become a major tourist destination in Europe [1].\n\n"
        "## Facilities \n"
        "Disneyland Paris comprises two theme parks: Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park. Disneyland Park features themed areas like Main Street USA, Adventureland, and Frontierland, offering a wide range of attractions such as Big Thunder Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean. Walt Disney Studios Park, opened in 2002, focuses on movie-themed experiences with attractions like Ratatouille: The Adventure and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. The resort also includes several hotels and Disney Village for shopping and dining, offering excellent and unforgettable travel experience [2].\n\n"
        "## Visitor Numbers \n"
        "In recent years, Disneyland Paris has seen significant visitor numbers. In 2023, the resort welcomed a total of 16.1 million visitors, narrowly beating its previous attendance record. Disneyland Park attracted 10.4 million visitors, while Walt Disney Studios Park saw 5.7 million, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Over its lifetime, Disneyland Paris has hosted more than 375 million visitors [3].\n\n"
        "## Notable Recent Events \n"
        "Notable recent events include the celebration of Disneyland Paris's 30th anniversary in 2022. The resort has also been recognized for its innovative experiences and storytelling. In addition, Disneyland Paris has expanded its offerings with new attractions and themed areas, such as the Marvel Avengers Campus, which opened in 2022. These developments have helped maintain the resort's position as a leading European tourist destination [4].\n\n"
